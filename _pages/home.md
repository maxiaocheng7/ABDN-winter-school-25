## Welcome!

Welcome to the 1st Winter School on the Frontiers of Large Language Models in Aberdeen (LLMs-Aberdeen). LLMs-Aberdeen is planned as a 4-day hybrid event, hosted at the School of Natural and Computing Sciences at the University of Aberdeen on 21-24 Jan, 2025 (tentative). We would live-stream all the lectures for remote audiences, as well as record the event. All the recordings would be made publicly available afterwards. 

Recent years have seen groundbreaking innovations in unsupervised learning and scalable architectures, leading to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in LLMs such as ChatGPT and LLaMA have been phenomenal, revolutionizing artificial intelligence both as a subject of study and as a tool with the potential to shape all disciplines and industries. Despite the huge opportunities, we are just at the beginning of achieving this ambiguous plan, with many challenges such as trustworthiness, safety, alignment, multimodality and real-time ability far from being solved. This winter school is intended to be the first event of its kind in Scotland to cover the opportunities and challenges in LLMs, providing training opportunities to students and researchers who are interested in contributing to the next generation of artificial intelligence.
