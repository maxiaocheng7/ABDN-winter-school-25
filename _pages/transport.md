## By Car

Entering the city from the south or west, follow signs for the A90 (Fraserburgh and Peterhead). This leads round the ring road (Anderson Drive). Exiting from a roundabout (signed Old Aberdeen) onto Cairncry Road, continue to follow the A90 signs through two further roundabouts onto St. Machar Drive. After a third roundabout, the road bisects Old Aberdeen and local signs will direct you to University sites. From the north, Old Aberdeen is signposted on the A96 (from Dyce and Inverness) and on the A90 (from Peterhead).
